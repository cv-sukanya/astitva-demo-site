                    <p>With a rich experience in the field of education, we actively collaborate with the Shirpur Educational Society (SES) and several other educational institutions to provide the highest learning for the local populace. Owing to our extensive experience, we have partnered with four tribal schools and actively organise extracurricular workshops and awareness programs that provide holistic learning. With free basic education, nourishment, and general development, we ensure the futures of these tribal children are secured.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>At Shirpur, a lack of infrastructure and affordability led to poor educational conditions. Not only were people unemployed, but they were also actively seeking income opportunities elsewhere. Astitva developed a provision for free education for all age groups by collaborating with residential schools, also known as ashram shalas. Irrespective of their background, people with a passion for learning and growth are always welcome at these shalas.</p>

Many academic facilities have enabled over 50% of the population at Shirpur to be literate. Even now, advanced degree programs are being set up to benefit a once marginalised community so they may soar to new heights.</p>

                    <p>An enterprising idea of Shirpur 60 was founded with the thought to provide underprivileged tribal children with equal opportunity. This initiative arranges free education and meals for 60 tribal children annually. The education they receive, teamed with sports training, access to technology, and more, has enabled them to stand neck to neck with students from metropolitan regions. So far, over 2000 tribal families have profited from the venture while we continue to enrich the lives of our students.</p>

                        Menstruation Awareness

                    </div>
                    <p>In many rural areas, girls often felt scared and confused about their periods because no one spoke openly about it. Astitva changed this by organizing workshops where girls could ask questions and learn about menstruation. These sessions taught them about hygiene, broke old myths, and helped them feel normal about this natural process. With the right knowledge and support, girls felt more confident to attend school regularly, even during their periods. What once felt like a secret burden turned into something they could handle proudly and fearlessly.</p>

                        Children’s Movement for Civic Awareness

                    <!-- <p>With rich experience in the field of education, having created and run several educational institutions, the extension of that activity in Shirpur was only natural. For the highest learning, educational institutions were established,
                        providing opportunities for higher learning for the local populace. At the basic level, 4 ashram shalas have been set up, where tribal children are offered free education, taking care of their nutritional needs, and overall development.</p> -->
                    <p>Astitva believes in shaping future leaders by teaching children the importance of civic responsibility. Through this initiative, children are encouraged to take part in local community projects that address real problems, such as waste management or improving public spaces. With guidance and mentorship, these young minds learn to turn their ideas into meaningful actions. The program helps children feel confident and united as they work together to create positive change in their neighborhoods. This not only strengthens their communities but also builds a sense of pride and responsibility in the next generation​.</p>

                    <p>
                        Art has a special power—it can heal and bring peace to the mind. Through Astitva’s Healing Through Art initiative, in partnership with the Mind and Arts Institute, individuals find a safe space to express their emotions. Each brushstroke becomes a way to let out unspoken feelings, and every color tells a story of hope and healing.
                        <br> <br>
                        This program goes beyond regular learning. It helps people deal with stress, discover their inner strength, and feel more balanced. By using art as therapy, Astitva shows that creativity can mend hearts, build resilience, and light the way to a brighter, more peaceful future.

                        Fighting Early Child Marriage

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Early child marriage robs children, especially girls, of their right to education and a better future. Astitva’s initiative to combat this practice focuses on empowering communities through awareness and education. Through interactive workshops, the program creates safe spaces for children to voice their fears and dreams, helping them see a life beyond early marriage.
                        <br><br>
                        By promoting the importance of education, the initiative encourages families to prioritize schooling over marriage for their daughters. These efforts not only protect children from an uncertain future but also equip them with the tools and confidence to build brighter lives. Astitva believes that by keeping children in school, we can break the cycle of early marriage and create a generation that values education and self-reliance.
